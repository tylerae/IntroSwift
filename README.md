# Overview

## I have loved programming in C++ using Xcode but I wanted to learn more about mobile app building, using swift. I had some trouble with learning a new language but set out to make a timer app. It allowed me to learn the Xcode interface for app making and also dive into swift.

# Development Environment

## I used Xcode as my IDE for this project. I have used Xcode for C++ and found it very intuitive. I used the SwiftUI library for this project as an import. 

# Useful Websites

* [Swift Documentation](https://www.swift.org/documentation/)
* [Tutorial Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/swift/index.htm)

# Future Work

* I would like to have done more Debugging
* I will make adjustments to have a more user friendly interface.
